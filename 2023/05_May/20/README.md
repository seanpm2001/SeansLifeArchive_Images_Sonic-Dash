### Session 0

Undocumented.

### Session 1

I had an after-midnight session today. I originally began to play this yesterday, but had to uninstall and reinstall it to reset my progress. It was very difficult as the play store was corrupted. I had to reset the Google Play Store, as the app refused to update, got stuck pending, or the store would just crash. It took over 30 minutes to fix, before I could play and make my progress back.

I made lots of progress today, screenshots are a difficult factor on gameplay, as the game will pause for 3 seconds after each screenshot during the running phase. Upon quitting, I made it to level 7, and had a high score of 106,380, with 240 rings, 26 red star rings, and 1 diamond. I eventually finished up and went to bed. This will be a daily thing. I also plan to focus on other old games. - 2023, Thursday, May 18th

### Session 2

I had another after-midnight session today.  I made lots of progress today. Upon quitting, I made it to level 11, unlocked Green Hll Zone, and had a high score of 167,544, with 1,739 rings, 0 red star rings, and 21 diamonds. This was my first session with advertisements. I eventually finished up and went to bed. This will be a daily thing. I also plan to focus on other old games. - 2023, Friday, May 19th

### Session 3

My session started before midnight, but lasted past midnight, so I will count it as a separate session from session 2. I made some progress today, and leveled up to level 12. I ended with a new high score of 277,662, along with 1,416 rings, 15 red star rings, and 61 seconds. This was my second session with advertisements. I later finished up and went to bed. - 2023, Saturday, May 20th
