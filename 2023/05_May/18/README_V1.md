# Sonic Dash Session 2023 May 18th

## Session 0

Undocumented.

## Session 1

I had an after-midnight session today. I originally began to play this yesterday, but had to uninstall and reinstall it to reset my progress. It was very difficult as the play store was corrupted. I had to reset the Google Play Store, as the app refused to update, got stuck pending, or the store would just crash. It took over 30 minutes to fix, before I could play and make my progress back.

I made lots of progress today, screenshots are a difficult factor on gameplay, as the game will pause for 3 seconds after each screenshot during the running phase. Upon quitting, I made it to level 7, and had a high score of 106,380, with 240 rings, 26 red star rings, and 1 diamond. I eventually finished up and went to bed. This will be a daily thing. I also plan to focus on other old games. - 2023, Thursday, May 18th
